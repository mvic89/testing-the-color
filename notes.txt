React Testing Library Queries:
  getByRole() - page 20. (tests element using a class attribute.)
    Testing props (w. mockData) - page 21
    Testing props from a parent - page 22
  getAllBy - page 23 ('All' queries return arrays)
  getByTestId - page 24 (if an element has a generic role (ex <div>). we can test using the id attribute)
  get vs query - page 25
    get: returns the matching element and throws an error the element is not found or multiple elements are found.
    queryBy: returns the matching element and throws an error if multiple elements are found, but it returns ‘null’ if no element is found.
